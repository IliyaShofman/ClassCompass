# ClassCompass

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
   `git clone git@github.com:goelbenj/ClassCompass.git`
2. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your machine
3. Initialize `FLASK_PORT` environment variable to be the port the flask container should bind. For example `export FLASK_PORT=7001`. By Default, `FLASK_PORT=5001` will be used.
4. Initialize `REACT_PORT` environment variable to be the port the react container should bind. For example `export REACT_PORT=7002`. By Default, `REACT_PORT=5002` will be used.
   1. (Optional) to expose the flask-server and Metro frontend bundler on your local network, initialize
      the `HOSTNAME` environment variable to be your host machine's private IP address. For example,
      `export HOSTNAME=10.123.45.67`. By default, `HOSTNAME=localhost` will be used.
5. Run `bash dev.sh build` from the root of the repository to build the development images
6. Run `bash dev.sh up` from the root of the repository to attach to the development container
   - To only build the flask-server and react-native application run `bash dev.sh build flask-server`
     and `bash dev.sh build react-app` respectively
7. The flask server should be running in the docker container on port 7001 and the react native
   application should be running in the development environment with expo on port 7002
8. Bring down the container(s) with `bash dev.sh down`

## Project Management Tools

We are using Notion to perform project management, however, it is a private project
which cannot be shared

## Contributing

If you want to make a contribution, please follow the next steps:

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch from `develop` (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature)
3. Commit your Changes (git commit -m '<type>(<scope>): <subject>')
4. Push the Branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)
5. Open a Pull Request to be merged into `develop`, do **not** target `main`

## Releases

Releases are to be created by merging `develop` into `main`, `main` will then be used to create a release
